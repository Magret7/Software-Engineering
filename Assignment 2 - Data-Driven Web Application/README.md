## Data-Driven Web Applications

Data-Driven Web Application using Flask to perform CRUD operations: Create, Read, Update and Delete.

1. showBook.html
   - This page list all available books. For each book, it provides the user with the options to either edit the book title or delete the book's data from the dictionary. 
3. editBook.html
   - When a user enters a string in the displayed textbox, it will replace the book's title in the corresponding dictionary.
5. deleteBook.html
   - When a user hits the delete button, the corresponding dictionary of that book (title and id) will be deleted from the list of the available books.
7. newBook.html
   - When a user enters a string in the displayed textbox, a new dictionary will be added to the list of available books.
   - The Dictionary will have the entered string and assigns it the next available id (i.e., the first found empty slot).
