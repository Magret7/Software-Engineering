# Diplomacy Game


Listed in the follwing folder is a project in Python the encapultes the Diplomacy Game.

The game Diplomacy is about warfare (ironic, ain't it?). Armies are located in various cities, and can attack cities, defend cities, and support other armies. My job is to compute the status of various armies after they make 1 round of moves.
